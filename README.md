# Risk-on-Cervical-Cancer

1. The Project was made on the occassion of Women's Day 2021, so as to create an awareness of protecting from Cervical Cancer.
2. The Project is based on finding solutions of a Classification Dataset.
3. It shows various ways to deal with missing values followed by feature Engineering and statistical methods of data analysis.
4. It also shows on how to deal with an imbalanced dataset using sampling techniques.
5. Moreover,with Cross-Validation Technique, I find the the best Classification model that best fits the data.
6. Confusion Matrix , a statistical method to find the true positive and negative rate and false positive and negative rate of data, that gives a detail of how the model 
has predicted followed on what is actually there in the data, i.e. Error rate of Prediction by Algorithm.

#Challeneges

1. This is my first classification dataset which I am working on with, dealing with certain things which are new and something which was already learned well and is easy to implement.
2. Getting the performance score was initially a challenge but later on I found out that what was more necessary to make it work well.

Stay Tuned for more projects like this.

Thank You...
